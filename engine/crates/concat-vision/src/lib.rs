//! What the engine sees in a picture.
//!
//! A cutout takes a picture's background away without a key colour: a
//! model says, pixel by pixel, how likely each one is to be the person, and
//! the picture's alpha is multiplied by the answer. This crate is the whole
//! of that, in four parts:
//!
//! - [`mask`]: the answer itself, an eight-bit probability picture, with
//!   the sampling, softening and PNG form everything else uses.
//! - [`strokes`]: the corrections. A custom cutout paints brush strokes
//!   over the model's mask; this is where a stroke becomes pixels.
//! - [`apply`]: the frame with its background gone. One function, called
//!   by the exporter and the monitor alike, so the file and the screen
//!   agree by construction.
//! - [`store`]: where masks live between runs. They are keyed by the media
//!   file and the source instant, and cached in the project folder like
//!   its waveforms, so a cutout is found once and travels with the edit.
//!
//! Finding the mask is [`segment`], behind the `infer` feature: the model
//! is compiled in and run by tract, in pure Rust, so a cutout needs no
//! download and no runtime library, on a desk or a phone. The renderer
//! reads masks and never infers; the host infers and writes them.
//!
//! Masks are square at the model's resolution whatever the picture's
//! shape, and every position in them is a fraction of the source picture:
//! `(0, 0)` its top-left, `(1, 1)` its bottom-right. Strokes are stored in
//! the same fractions. A crop, a flip or a change of output size therefore
//! changes nothing about a mask - the mapping from a decoded pixel back to
//! a source fraction is [`apply::Mapping`], and it is the one place those
//! are undone.
