/**
 * The playback clock.
 *
 * The engine owns it: the position that matters is the audio device's sample
 * counter, reported through `transport` events at ~30Hz. Between events the
 * UI interpolates on the wall clock from the last reported anchor, so the
 * playhead moves at animation rate while never drifting further than one
 * event interval from the truth.
 *
 * In a plain browser (`npm run dev` with no Rust host) there is no engine and
 * the anchor simply never gets corrected - the wall clock alone is the same
 * prototype behaviour this file always had there.
 */
/**
 * The methods, kept apart from the values on purpose. `playhead` changes
 * every animation frame while playing; the methods never change at all. One
 * object holding both would get a fresh identity per frame, and everything
 * keyed on it - effect deps, memoised children - would churn at 60fps. So
 * consumers that only *drive* the transport take `controls` (one stable
 * identity for the life of the hook) and never re-render on playback, while
 * the few that *display* the playhead subscribe to it explicitly.
